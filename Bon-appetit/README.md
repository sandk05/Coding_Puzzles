# Bon	App√©tit

Anna and Brian order ***n*** items at	a restaurant,	but	Anna declines to eat any of the ***k<sup>th</sup>*** item (where **0 <= *k* <*n***) due to an allergy. When the check comes, they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared; however, Brian may have forgotten that they didn't split the  ***k<sup>th</sup>*** item and	accidentally charged Anna	for it.

You	are	given	***n*** ,***k*** ,	the	cost	of	each	of	the	 ***n*** items,	and	the	total	amount	of	money	that	Brian	charged	Anna for	her	portion	of	the	bill.	If	the	bill	is	fairly	split,	print	Bon	Appetit;	otherwise,	print	the	amount	of	money that	Brian	must	refund	to	Anna.

**Input	Format**

The	first	line	contains	two	space-separated	integers	denoting	the	respective	values	of ***n*** (the	number	of
items	ordered) and	***k*** (the	 **0**-based	index	of	the	item	that	Anna	did	not	eat).	
The	second	line	contains	 ***n*** space-separated	integers	where	each	integer ***i*** denotes	the	cost, **_c_[_i_]**	 ,	of	item	
(where **0 <= *i* < *n***).	
The	third	line	contains	an	integer,***b<sub>charged</sub>*** ,	denoting	the	amount	of	money	that	Brian	charged	Anna	for	her share	of	the	bill.

**Constraints**
- **2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>**
- **0 <= *k* < *n***
- **0 <= _c_[_i_] <= 10<sup>4</sup>**
- **0 <= _b_ <= sum of all _c_[_i_]**

**Output	Format**

If	Brian	did	not	overcharge	Anna,	print	Bon	Appetit	on	a	new	line;	otherwise,	print	the	difference	(i.e.,	
)	that	Brian	must	refund	to	Anna	(it	is	guaranteed	that	this	will	always	be	an	integer).

**Sample	Input 0**

```

**Explanation	0**
Anna	didn't	eat	item ***c*[1] = 10** ,but	she	shared	the	rest	of	the	items	with	Brian.	The	total	cost	of	the	shared items	is **3 + 2 + 9 = 14** and,	split	in half, the cost per person	is ***b<sub>actual</sub>* = 7**. Brian	charged	her ***b<sub>charged</sub>* = 12** for her	portion of the bill, which	is	more	than	the	 **7** dollars	worth	of	food	that	she	actually shared	with	him.	Thus,	we	print	the	amount	Anna	was	overcharged, ***b<sub>charged</sub> - b<sub>actual</sub>* = 12 - 7 = 5**, on a new	line.

Bon Appetit

**Explanation	1**
Anna	didn't	eat	item ***c*[1] = 10**,	but	she	shared	the	rest	of	the	items	with	Brian.	The	total	cost	of	the	shared
items is **3 + 2 + 9 = 14**  and, split in half,	the	cost	per	person is ***b<sub>actual* = 7** .	Because	this	matches	the amount,	 ***b<sub>charged* = 7**,	that	Brian charged Anna for her portion	of the bill, we print Bon Appetit on a new line.
