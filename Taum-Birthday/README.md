# Taum and B'day

Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha. There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white. To make her happy, Taum has to buy ***b*** black gifts and ***w*** white gifts.
- The cost of each black gift is ***bc*** units.
- The cost of every white gift is ***wc*** units.
- The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is ***z*** units.
Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.

**Input Format**

The first line will contain an integer ***t***, the number of test cases.
The next ***t*** pairs of lines are as follows: - The first line contains the values of integers ***b*** and ***w***. - The next line contains the values of integers ***bc***, ***wc***, and ***z***.

**Constraints**

**1 <= *t* < 10**

**0 <= *b,w,bc,wc,z* <= 10<sup>9</sup>**

**Output Format**

***t*** lines, each containing an integer: the minimum amount of units Taum needs to spend on gifts.

**Sample Input**

```
5
10 10
1 1 1
5 9
2 3 4
3 6
9 1 1
7 7
4 2 1
3 3
1 9 2
```
**Sample Output**

```
20
37
12
35
12
```
**Explanation**

- *Test Case #01:*
Since black gifts cost the same as white, there is no benefit to converting the gifts. Taum will have to buy each gift for 1 unit. The cost of buying all gifts will be: **b * bc + w * wc = 10 * 1 + 10 * 1 = 20**.

- Test Case #02:
Again, we can't decrease the cost of black or white gifts by converting colors.***z*** is too high. We will buy gifts at their original prices, so the cost of buying all gifts will be: **b * bc + w * wc = 5 * 2 + 9 * 3 = 10 + 27 = 37**.

- *Test Case #03:*
Since **bc < bw + z**, we will buy **b + w = 3 + 6 = 9** white gifts at their original price of **1**. ***b* = 3** of the gifts must be black, and the cost per conversion, **z = 1**. Total cost is **9 * 1 + 3 * 1 = 12**.

- *Test Case #04:*
Similarly, we will buy ***w* = 7** white gifts at their original price,***wc* = 2**. For black gifts, we will first buy white ones and color them to black, so that their cost will be reduced to ***wc + z* = 2 + 1 = 3**. So cost of buying all gifts will be: **7 * 3 + 7 * 2 = 35**.

- *Test Case #05:* 
We will buy black gifts at their original price,***bc* = 1**. For white gifts, we will first black
gifts worth ***bc* = 1** unit and color them to white for ***z* = 2** units. The cost for white gifts is reduced to ***wc = bc + z* = 2 + 1 = 3** units. The cost of buying all gifts will be: **3 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12**.
