# Sherlock and

# Squares

Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of *square integers* within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.
**Note** : A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. **1, 4, 9, 16, 25**.
For example, the range is **a = 24** and **b = 49**, inclusive. There are three square integers in the range: **25, 36** and **49**.
**Function Description**
Complete the *squares* function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from ***a*** to ***b***.
squares has the following parameter(s):
- a: an integer, the lower range boundary
- b: an integer, the uppere range boundary

**Input Format**
The first line contains ***q***, the number of test cases.
Each of the next ***q*** lines contains two space-separated integers denoting ***a*** and ***b***, the starting and ending integers in the ranges.

**Constraints**

**1 <= *q* <= 100**

**1 <= *a* <= *b* <= 10<sup>9</sup>** 

**Output Format**
For each test case, print the number of square integers in the range on a new line.
**Sample Input**

```
2 
3 9
17 24 
```
**Sample Output**
```
2
0 
```
**Explanation**
Test Case *#00*: In range **[3, 9], 4** and **9** are the two square integers.
Test Case *#01*: In range **[17,24]**, there are no square integers.
